# chatroom

very well Aka, let the games begin. We decided with Markus to give you a coding assignment to play with. Once you have finished it you can go through parts of the solution with Marko and Markus and discuss about it.
Here’s the assigment:
Design and build a simple multi-user chatroom web application and a messaging backend with message history persistance. The user should be able to:

1. Choose a username

2. Join three different (you can choose the themes) chatrooms/channels

3. Send messages to other users

You should build the front end with a modern JavaScript (gain extra points by using TypeScript!) framework, preferably with React. If you end up choosing another framework, we would love to hear a short sales pitch to support your decision. The application should be responsive. You are free to choose your backend technology, but we would like to see either Java, Scala or Node.js.

Don’t be afraid to show your strengths and interests. If you love good design and polished UI, feel free to make use of tasteful animations, a responsive grid, nice typography and overall a coherent design language. If you’re more into devops, impress us with your dockerzation skills or automated deployment pipeline.

The application should somehow reflect your vision of software development best practises. In addition to your code being available at github or similar, we would love to see it running online. （編集済み） 
Are you up for a challenge?
